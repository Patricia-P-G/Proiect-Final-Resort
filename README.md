This is my React Resort Booking App, created as part of the web development course at IT School. The project focuses on the rebranding of The Racha resortâ€™s online booking platform. On the site, users can browse and book accommodations, explore resort amenities and view detailed room descriptions with images. 


The project is deployed here: https://sunset-breeze-resort.netlify.app/
